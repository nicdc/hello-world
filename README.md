Figuring out UNIX
Hello all you wonderful people on GitHub!
I'm trying to get familiar with this environment in order to correctly submit jobs for cluster computing without crashing the server :) 
Would appreciate any help from people familiar with these environments, particularly with brain imaging applications.
Thanks, and happy developing!
